# christinaChan_exploreOpenSource
This project is part of the Explore Open Source Challenge through Girls Who Code and College Loops. In this challenge, we responded to the following prompt:

Delilah is a self-starter, and she created an app to get young girls excited about learning technology. Many kids have already tested the app, and she has been getting very positive reviews.

Since Delilah sourced most of her user-testers through her network, their backgrounds are all very similar to hers. Delilah wants her app to be more inclusive, but she doesnâ€™t know how to find and approach more potential user-testers from underrepresented minorities. What can be some first steps?

My response to the prompt is below:

Collecting demographics would be helpful to determine the populations Delilah is reaching, and including some changes as she figures out how to reach more people would be good. 
Changes include making content more inclusive / diverse to attract a wider range of people and making it known that her app is meant for everyone. 
Along with these immediate changes, she can make long term plans to connect with consumers and others to see how she can improve the app and expand her reach.


Awesome idea, Christina!!!

This looks so good!
